  <p>I have created this site to display mockups, prototypes, proof of concepts that I have created along the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am using this site to keep a running code library of my design and development techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have split the projects into design and development projects and seperate catagoies under each.  As you find interesting projects that you want to see in action you can choose the catagory and then view a live presentation of the project by click the "web" button or look at the code on GitHub by clicking the "github" button.</p>
