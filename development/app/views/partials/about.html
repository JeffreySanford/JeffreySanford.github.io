		<p>I love programming; the logic structures, the semantics, the code.  It has given me a lifelong creative outlet and assisted me in many facets with associated work.  My first computer was an Atari 400 with 16K of RAM and Atari BASIC that on which I taught myself programming with the help of the programming community.  I have used that knowledge my entire life.</p>
    <p>After working on developing radar systems in the Army, then gaining expertise in technical, desktop and network support, I returned to my passion for programming.  Most recently, I have been designing websites in modern standards of HTML5 and CSS3, but putting a major focus on advanced JavaScript techniques and several frameworks, my favorite being AngularJS.</p>
		<p>I am passionate about working on complex platforms and in multiple programming languages, and I have gained experience back-end programming mostly in NodeJS, as well as PHP, Java, Visual Basic.  I enjoy working with data models in mySQL, MSSQL, and MongoDB.</p>
