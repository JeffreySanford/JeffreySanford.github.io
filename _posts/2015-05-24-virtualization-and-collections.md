summary:    Initial writeup on the use of Virtualization and Collecions in a deelopment eviroment.  Heavily reliant on the www.docker.com technology, collections enable the deeloper to creaa a pre-existing image upon which to work, speaking up he developement eviroments drastically.

Virtualization and Collections

https://www.docker.com

These is a tutorial on the idea of collecions on docker itself and it is very good.  Check out https://www.docker.com/tryit/ and the documentation seesm to be prety good at https://docs.docker.com/articles/basics/.

Virtualizations is a wonderful thing that has been around since the early mainframe and has recently started gaining ground again in the technology sector.  The ability to use one physical machine o it's full disk, processor and memory capicity while not losing (in fact gaining sometimes) perforamance is beneficial for the return on investment and saves in system and hardwares engineering costs.

In the development and programming sector, this is a fantastic idea because you can uild of a functional image tha supports some of the modern programming enviroments already tested and working and use those functiosn to perform your operations from.

Collections take it a step further, in that instead of installing a full operaing system and treating it as a seperate insallaion of a machine you run an image -- a copy of an enviroment  -- that is able to execute functions because of the inherant properies of that enviroment.  Pretty fancy idea.




A sample collection, this blog fact, to be used as a virutalized collecion.
